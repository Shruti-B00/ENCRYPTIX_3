This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. The project leverages historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, to build predictive models.

The implementation demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, to accurately identify customers likely to churn.
